## What is this application?
This application is for scheduling appointments. It can be customized per the business needs, whether it's a tattoo studio, a hair salon, or a scuba diving facility. The users will log in, select the date they want to have an appointment, and then based on the current appointments already scheduled, present the user with times that are available.
